# Unveiling Hidden Customer Segments: A Predictive EDA of E-commerce Purchase Behavior

## Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on e-commerce sales data to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior and product preferences.  The analysis aims to uncover hidden patterns and insights that can inform targeted marketing strategies and enhance customer personalization efforts.  The project utilizes various data visualization and statistical techniques to reveal key customer segments and their characteristics.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (optional, depending on implemented clustering algorithms)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.  Then, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key findings and statistical summaries to the console, providing insights into customer segmentation.  Additionally, the analysis will generate several visualization files (e.g., `customer_segment_distribution.png`, `product_affinity_matrix.png`, etc.)  These plots visually represent the identified customer segments and their relationships with different products.  The specific output files may vary depending on the implemented analysis.  The generated plots will be saved in the `output` directory.


## Data

The project requires a properly formatted CSV file containing e-commerce transaction data.  A sample data file may be included in the `data` directory, but it's recommended to replace this with your own dataset for analysis. The expected data format should include at least customer ID, product ID, purchase date, and purchase amount.
